# Localization of Manipulated Image Regions


**Problem Statement**

The difference between authentic and manipulated photos has become harder to distinguish with the advancement of image editing tools. It is therefore a widespread demand to build automatic tools to identify how and which part of the image has been manipulated.
Here, we want to address the problem of detecting and localization of copy-move and splicing forgeries in images: given an input image, localizing the spliced region which is cut from another image.
